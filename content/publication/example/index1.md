title: Semiparametric estimation of probabilistic index models; efficiency and bias
abstract: Many well known rank tests can be viewed as score tests under probabilistic index models[:] regression models for the conditional probability that the outcome of one randomly chosen subject exceeds the outcome of another independently chosen subject. Probabilistic index models (PIMs) provide a natural regression framework for nonparametric rank tests. In addition, PIMs supplement these tests with effect sizes and ease the development of more flexible tests e.g., tests which allow for covariate adjustment. Inference for probabilistic index models is currently based on an estimator, referred to as the standard estimator, that was heuristically derived. By appealing to semiparametric theory and a Hoeffding decomposition, we rigorously derive the class of all consistent and asymptotically normal estimators for the parameters indexing a probabilistic index model. We identify the (locally) semiparametric efficient estimator in this class and we derive a second estimator which has smaller second-order finitesample bias. The properties of the estimators are theoretically and empirically evaluated. The heuristic standard estimator turns out to be the preferred estimator in practice as it is computationally superior to both the efficient and the bias-reduced estimator, and only suffers from a minor loss in efficiency. We propose a partition strategy to further improve the computational performance of the standard estimator.
