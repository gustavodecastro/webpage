I am currently a Research Assistant Professor in Biostaitstics at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. I am originally from Brazil, the state of Minas Gerais, where I grew up and studied Physics (BSc) and later Statistics and Probability (MSc) at the Federal University of Minas Gerais. Later I moved across the globe to obtain my PhD in Statistics at The University of Auckland, where I was very fortunate to work under the supervision of Professors Chris Wild and Alastair Scott. I spent a few years in Belgium as a postdoctoral researcher; first at Ghent University, where I had the pleasure to work with Professors Olivier Thas, Stijn Vansteelandt, and Jan de Neve, and later at Janssen Pharmaceutica.

My research is mostly centered around developing new statistical methods to design and analyze data obtained via complex designs. Our proposed designs are currently being implemented in large validation studies in Latin America and East Africa, in selected CCASAnet and IDEA sites. My collaborations are mostly in Tuberculosis or HIV. I am part of the RePORT Brazil team, which investigates the impact of TB in the country. I also work closely with Friends in Global Health, in Mozambique.
